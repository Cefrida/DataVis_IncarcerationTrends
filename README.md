# DataVis_IncarcerationTrends

This class, Data Visualization (Data 201), was taken during my junior year (Fall 2023). In this class, I was I able to combine my creative side with visualization techniques to create meaningful visualizations, drawing valuable insights on a variety of topics. One of these topics, Incarceration, is extremely important to me. Thus this project is my most meaningful piece of work.

This project combines several visualizations made using Tableau.
