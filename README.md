# DataVis_IncarcerationTrends

This class, Data Visualization (Data 201) was taken during my junior year (Fall 2023). This class was extremely time consuming but is my favorite class I have taken so far. During this class, I was I able to combine my creative side with visualization techniques to create meaningful visualizations, drawing valuable insights on a variety of topics. One of these topics, Incarceration, which I was able to select, is very important to me and thus this project is my most meaningful piece of work.

This project combines several visualizations made using tableau.
